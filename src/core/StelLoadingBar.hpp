//! of the StelLoadingBar, and a text display area, whose contents may also be
//! modified after the creation of the StelLoadingBar.
//! It can also have an image which is set at object creation time, and some
//! static text (called extra text, which is set at object creation time.
//! Stellarium's splash screen, visible when the program is first started, is
//! a StelLoadingBar.  The image is the logo for the project, the extra text is
//! used to show the application name and version.

#include <QObject>

//! @class StelDialog
//! Base class for all the GUI windows in Stellarium.
//! 
//! Windows in Stellarium are actually basic QWidgets that have to be wrapped in
//! a QGraphicsProxyWidget (CustomProxy) to be displayed by StelMainView
//! (which is derived from QGraphicsView). See the Qt documentation for details.
//! 
//! The base widget needs to be populated with controls in the implementation
//! of the createDialogContent() function. This can be done either manually, or
//! by using a .ui file. See the Qt documentation on using Qt Designer .ui files
//! for details.
//! 
//! The createDialogContent() function itself is called automatically the first
//! time setVisible() is called with "true".
//! 
//! Moving a window is done by dragging its title bar, defined in the BarFrame
//! class. Every derived window class needs a BarFrame object - it
//! has to be either included in a .ui file, or manually instantiated in
//! createDialogContent().

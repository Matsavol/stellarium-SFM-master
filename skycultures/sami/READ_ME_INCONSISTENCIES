There are several inconsistencies in this sky culture:
- the star Vega is identified in the description file as both the Runner and
the Morning Star
- at the same time, the constellation labels identify Altair as the Morning
Star
- the only other source on Sami ethnoastronomy I could find online,
http://www.starlab.com/PDFs/D.14.Lapp-SamiMythology.pdf , lists Venus as the
Morning and Evening star
- the same source also provides a different form/transcription of the Hunter's
name (here: Favdna, there: Favnta).
- there's also an uclear sentence about the Milky Way
("...as connect to the seasons.")
